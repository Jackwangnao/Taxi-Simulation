## Description

The following source codes were created for the course "simulation of complex systems" at Chalmers University of Technology 2012. The code simulates a taxi cab company using a multi-agent-based model based on assumptions from a real-world scenario.

For more information, see my post, animation and article of the simulation: http://matzjb.se/2014/01/taxi-company-dispatch-simulation/


#Prerequisites
Matlab, package matlab_bgl

#Setup
To run the code, add the path of this folder to Matlab and run Taxi5.m to create the city graph. When the graph has been created run Taxi_sim4.m to see the simulation.

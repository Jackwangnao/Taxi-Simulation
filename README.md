## Description

The following source codes were created for the course "simulation of complex systems" at Chalmers University of Technology 2012. The code simulates a taxi cab company using a multi-agent-based model based on assumptions from a real-world scenario.

Read the report for the assumptions and the conclusions: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2546393/Wordpress/reports/Matz%20JB%20-%20Simulation%20of%20Taxi%20Company%20-%2021i12b%7E12.pdf


#Prerequisites
Matlab, package matlab_bgl

#Setup
To run the code, add the path of this folder to Matlab and run Taxi5.m to create the city graph. When the graph has been created run Taxi_sim4.m to see the simulation.
